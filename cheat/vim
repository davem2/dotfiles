# File management

:e              reload file
:q              quit
:q!             quit without saving changes
:w              write file
:w {file}       write new file
:x              write file and exit

# Movement

    k
  h   l         basic motion
    j

w               next start of word
W               next start of whitespace-delimited word
e               next end of word
E               next end of whitespace-delimited word
b               previous start of word
B               previous start of whitespace-delimited word
0               start of line
$               end of line
gg              go to first line in file
G               go to end of file


# Insertion
#   To exit from insert mode use Esc or Ctrl-C
#   Enter insertion mode and:

a               append after the cursor
A               append at the end of the line
i               insert before the cursor
I               insert at the beginning of the line
o               create a new line under the cursor
O               create a new line above the cursor
R               enter insert mode but replace instead of inserting chars
:r {file}       insert from file

# Editing

u               undo
yy              yank (copy) a line
y{motion}       yank text that {motion} moves over
p               paste after cursor
P               paste before cursor
<Del> or x      delete a character
dd              delete a line
d{motion}       delete text that {motion} moves over


# Preceding a motion or edition with a number repeats it n times
# Examples:
50k         moves 50 lines up
2dw         deletes 2 words
5yy         copies 5 lines
42G         go to line 42

y(ank) - copy
d(elete) - cut
c(hange) - replace
p(aste) - put from buffer after cursor
o(pen) - start a new line
i(nsert) - insert before current character
a(ppend) - insert after current character
w(ord) - moves to beginning of next word
b(ack) - moves to beginning of current word or prior word
e(nd) - moves to end of current word or next word
f(ind) - moves to a character on the current line
movement keys you just need to learn: h,j,k,l

^ - beginning of text on a line
$ - end of text on a line
0 - first position on line

most commands can be prefaced with numeric modifiers.
2w - means move 2 words
5h - means move 5 characters to the left
3k - means move 3 lines up
3fs - means move to the 3rd letter s folling the cursor

modification commands (d,c,y) need to know how much to work on.
dd - delete a line into memory
yy - yank a line into memory
cc - change the whole line
c$ - change from current position to the end
c2w - change the text spanning the next 2 words
3dd - delete 3 lines
d2f. - delete to the second period.

. - means redo the last modification command.
/ - searches for text, and then n(ext) will go the next found occurance. N will go prior.
? - searches backwards through the document.

Basic ex commands:
:w myfile.txt  - save current file as 'myfile.txt'
:q  -  quit the document
:q! - REALLY QUIT w/o saving
:w! myfile.txt - try to force saving to 'myfile.txt' even if there are warnings
:wq - write out the current document and quit
:r [filename]  - read filename into the current document
:w %.old - write the current file as  [originalfilename].old
:0 - go to the top of the document
:22 - go to line 22
:$ - go to the bottom of the document

Next you should learn m(arks) - place holders in the current doc.
ma - mark the current line as 'a'
mb - mark the current line as 'b'
'a - go to mark a
y'a - yank all the lines from the current position to mark-a
