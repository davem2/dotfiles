T 1430372956 18<t4nk75418>	of my question:
T 1430372972 18<t4nk75418>	Maxwell's equations are correct in any inertial frame...regarding the final motion/momentum of the objects?

T 1430372989 18<jle`18>	if you apply the mechanics to study a system in one inertial frame, the results you predict will be the same as if you used the equations to study it in another inertial reference frame
T 1430373003 18<t4nk75418>	ok
T 1430373015 18<t4nk75418>	so, does relativity transform these forces, yet still tell you the results will be the same
T 1430373051 18<xihr18>	not sure what that question even means
T 1430373052 18<t4nk75418>	i guess i'm asking if equivalent result = equivalent force
T 1430373064 18<xihr18>	not making much sense
T 1430373073 18<t4nk75418>	ok, let me set up a problem
T 1430373074 18<xihr18>	forces are not frame invariant, if that's what you're asking

T 1430373102 18<xihr18>	the relativity principle states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames ... not that everything is exactly the same in all frames

T 1430373123 18<t4nk75418>	i'm asking if forces vary from frame to frame...by the exact amount that Maxwell's equations' predicted forces vary from frame to frame...(while all the time giving the same "result" of motion)
T 1430373275 18<jle`18>	i think looking at forces might be a red herring here
T 1430373347 18<xihr18>	Maxwell's equations don't "predict forces vary[ing] from frame to frame," so you seem very confused
T 1430373455 18<porcupine18>	do you mean whether the force is from an E or a vxB?
T 1430373480 18<t4nk75418>	ok, i'll set up my question
T 1430373495 18<t4nk75418>	anyone who actually is enjoying this can read if they like

T 1430373548 18<jle`18>	your general intuition might be correct here.  special relativity and maxwell's equations being the same under all reference frames are somewhat equivalent postulates, in a way.  you can derive one from the other.  you can eliminate B fields and call the resulting behavior a result of relativistically studying E, or you can assume invariance between frames and arrive at special relativity
T 1430373553 18<t4nk75418>	we're considering a stationary, charged wire, with 0 current, and an electron traveling alongside it.
T 1430373590 18<xihr18>	well, specifically, SR was developed to be compatible with Maxwell's equations ... that was the original motivation for Einstein's paper
T 1430373591 18<t4nk75418>	jle`: that does kind of make sense, actually

T 1430373643 18<jle`18>	yeah, the second direction in the relationship is more or less the commonly told story of the birth of SR
T 1430373720 18<xihr18>	well, given that it IS the birth of SR ...
T 1430373736 18<xihr18>	was: re: the title of his paper
T 1430373779 18<jle`18>	mhm
T 1430373899 18<t4nk75418>	thanks ^^
T 1430373955 18<jle`18>	if you study systems of charges moving at constant velocities or stationary and only look at E, and incorporate SR and relativistic effects...from length contraction, etc., you'll end up with behavior that looks a lot like what you'd consider classically, with a B field
