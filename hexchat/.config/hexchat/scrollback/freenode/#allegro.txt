T 1454332151 18<razieliyo18>	I have a doubt, I see the event tutorials doing the following: wait for event, if event, process it, then render if needed
T 1454332161 18<razieliyo18>	I was wondering how can I poll all events (I come from SDL)
T 1454332178 18<razieliyo18>	it's weird because no tutorial talks about polling all events, but just poll 1 on each frame
T 1454332187 18<razieliyo18>	well, on each loop iteration
T 1454332199 18<razieliyo18>	https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Allegro_5_Tutorial/Events
T 1454332312 18<Mr-Hide18>	razieliyo: you link every event sources you need to one event queue, and you use al_wait_for_event
T 1454332355 18<razieliyo18>	Mr-Hide, yes, I meant, if I get 3 events, like 3 key presses, with that code I will check just one for each loop I guess
T 1454332371 18<elias18>	that's just for this tutorial
T 1454332381 18<elias18>	the next tutorial will have proper event polling
T 1454332399 18<razieliyo18>	hmmm is that next tutorial online right now?

T 1454332487 18<elias18>	you were at the very first
T 1454332501 18<razieliyo18>	so according to that code, the while loop is running and if a keystroke comes, it's still processed once, the problem keeps the same in my understanding
T 1454332518 18<razieliyo18>	I mean, if three keystrokes are done, in each loop iter there will be just one processed
T 1454332573 18<razieliyo18>	maybe using while(al_wait_for_event(...)) processEvent(ev);
T 1454332582 18<elias18>	it checks if the queue is empty before doing any processing
T 1454332591 18<razieliyo18>	oh, right
T 1454332605 18<elias18>	so this is basically like a loop getting all events, and only then it handles the redraw
T 1454332611 18<elias18>	just formatted in a somewhat unusual way :)
T 1454332612 18<razieliyo18>	so the events are polled in that very while loop, ok ok
T 1454332620 18<razieliyo18>	yes, hehe I'm used to SDL
T 1454332620 18<elias18>	you could also do:
T 1454332629 18<razieliyo18>	where you just poll all events, then draw and do logic and whatever
T 1454332638 18<elias18>	while (!event_queue_is_emptxy()) { get_next_event(&event); ... }
T 1454332659 18<razieliyo18>	ok, nice, thanks elias and Mr-Hide 
T 1454332764 18<Tomasu18>	you can do an inner loop. for some reason i just like the single loop ;D
T 1454332950 18<razieliyo18>	so al_wait_for_event waits until one event comes, I guess this is not a problem for the rendering getting stuck because the rendering is also notified via an event (timer event)
T 1454333029 18<Tomasu18>	yup
T 1454333034 18<Tomasu18>	you get free sleeping out of that
