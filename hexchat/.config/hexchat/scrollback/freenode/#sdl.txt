T 1431391291 18<theweirdn818>	is this a bad idea to load a file into a list/vector of strings and parse from their instead of the file "directly"?
T 1431391453 18<caedes__18>	from their what?
T 1431391469 18<MrJones18>	that depends
T 1431391493 18<theweirdn818>	its a project file
T 1431391493 18<MrJones18>	if you're not ensuring arbitrary large files will not cause an arbitrary large list, yes
T 1431391497 18<caedes__18>	if the file is huge it's probably not such a great idea, otherwise it should be fine
T 1431391507 18<MrJones18>	well you should have a check tho
T 1431391515 18<MrJones18>	preferrably before allocating your list/vector :D
T 1431391517 18<theweirdn818>	so in theory it can be up to about hundreds of lines
T 1431391523 18<MrJones18>	or while filling it, at least not afterwards
T 1431391538 18<MrJones18>	theweirdn8: hundreds of lines is nothing. think in megabyte
T 1431391567 18<caedes__18>	.. unless one  line contains hundred thousands of chars :D
T 1431391590 18<caedes__18>	(ok, probably ten thousands would be bad enough, but whatever)
T 1431391608 18<theweirdn818>	http://pastebin.com/VEC9QYCG is an example small project
T 1431392619 18<MrJones18>	theweirdn8: no need to show example files, you should just consider such things beforehand and make sure to add a sensible limit :D
T 1431392687 18<theweirdn818>	Well, the main thing i am looking into is adding super nested folders for this
T 1431392707 18<caedes__18>	that almost looks like xml with all the <bla></bla> things
T 1431392714 18<caedes__18>	maybe just use real XML and a XML parser?
T 1431392732 18<theweirdn818>	real xml, does super nesting by default?
T 1431392745 18<caedes__18>	it's up to you how much you nest
T 1431392754 18<caedes__18>	but I personally prefer json anyway, it sucks less as a format
T 1431392773 18<caedes__18>	especially arrays in XML are no fun
T 1431392934 18<theweirdn818>	Yea, i was trying to only do nesting folders
T 1431392944 18<theweirdn818>	everything else i can handle via commas
T 1431392952 18<theweirdn818>	so its why i kinda dont want to use some external parser...
T 1431392984 18<MrJones18>	strict json is super annoying
T 1431392997 18<MrJones18>	like, why is [1,2,3,] not allowed
T 1431393032 18<MrJones18>	can't be bothered to do exact commas for the last list element in a config
T 1431393043 18<MrJones18>	well I guess for things you don't need to manually edit it's ok :D
T 1431393068 18<MrJones18>	sorry for spontaneous rant, saw json in a config recently and that annoyed me
T 1431393099 18<caedes__18>	I never thought about putting a comma at the end of a list
T 1431393150 18<MrJones18>	caedes__: it is very useful if you got large list elements
T 1431393213 18<MrJones18>	caedes__: http://fpaste.org/220851/13931891/ you don't want not to have that last comma, because if you ever copy things around you bet you'll forget to fix it
T 1431393219 18<MrJones18>	so best thing is to have each element exactly the same
T 1431393235 18<MrJones18>	all modern programming languages allow that in lists, even including older stuff like C
T 1431393238 18<MrJones18>	.. but json doesn't
T 1431393242 18<MrJones18>	at least with the python json parser
T 1431393255 18<MrJones18>	bites me every time I write something non-trivial in json
T 1431393844 18<theweirdn818>	idk
T 1431394501 18<caedes__18>	MrJones: well ok it can be useful and I'm also kinda surprised that json (or at least pythons parser) doesn't allow it, but it's still a lot less painful than XML
T 1431394553 18<caedes__18>	and both options are usually better than writing your own parser :D
T 1431398107 18<fzzy18>	do SDL_Textures reside in GPU memory?

T 1431400899 18<MrJones18>	so usually yes, unless you force the software renderer
T 1431405271 18<fzzy18>	what happens when there's too many SDL_Textures to fit into the GPU memory? Should I try to cache them somehow?

T 1431463444 18<Xeek18>	Consider your app gains focus, loses focus, and gains focus again, mean while the key was down at certain times but only released when the app had focus
T 1431463463 18<Xeek18>	then maybe under that (exceptional) circumstance it could happen

T 1431463572 18<Xeek18>	It was just what could be a possibility, more of a theory. It is the same key with the same consecutive up event, whence repeated

Trouble is SW renderer has poor performance while running.  Is there a way to use SW for loading and HW for running or something?
T 1431539182 18<Xeek18>	foreverska: going from software to software is faster because, it's all in the same memory... when you go to a texture in an accelerated renderer it's in a different kind of memory (video memory) so the transfer will be slower
T 1431539187 18<yin_nadie18>	I'm afraid not. The HW rendered performance comes at the cost of the textures being managed by the GPU, but loading textures to the GPU tales time

T 1431543553 18<Xeek18>	Why did you say that, is GDB a desktop?
T 1431543608 18<foreverska18>	*GDM is a display manager.
T 1431543622 18<foreverska18>	(GDB is on the brain because C)
T 1431543662 18<Xeek18>	Well, I am better with windows than linux
T 1431543677 18<Xeek18>	I still know my around in linux, job depends on it 
T 1431543680 18<yin_nadie18>	It's been a long time since I last used gdm, but want's it a little of a hog?
T 1431543688 18<yin_nadie18>	*wasn't it
T 1431543752 18<foreverska18>	It's a massive hog, atleast of HDD space if nothing else.  Once you've started it the only seamless thing you can do is start a desktop.  We're using stripped down LXDE.
T 1431543837 18<yin_nadie18>	have you tried xdm?
T 1431543865 18<yin_nadie18>	it looks retro, but it's bare bones
T 1431543903 18<foreverska18>	I tried xdm and slim when it was debian.  Trouble is Plymouth only has hooks for GDM
T 1431543916 18<foreverska18>	You get scary text flashes with anything else.
T 1431543969 18<yin_nadie18>	an other splash screens?
T 1431543976 18<foreverska18>	We don't even show the DM is the most annoying part of GDM.  It autologins and you never see it.
T 1431543989 18<foreverska18>	None as good as plymouth if they are even supported anymore.
T 1431544004 18<yin_nadie18>	pity
T 1431544037 18<yin_nadie18>	hmm
T 1431544047 18<yin_nadie18>	and do you actually require a splash screen for this?
T 1431544047 18<foreverska18>	It's a beautiful boot process in Plymouth but Ubuntu practically owns it's production so you get stuck with their bloat.
T 1431544059 18<foreverska18>	For the casuals... yea.
T 1431544063 18<yin_nadie18>	what about directly going into the desktop, bypassing authentication?
T 1431544082 18<yin_nadie18>	casuals tend to prefer that
T 1431544177 18<foreverska18>	The other reason we are using Ubuntu is debian forked Kodi to avoid their bin blobs.  Casuals like KODI and not XBMC for Debian.
T 1431544237 18<foreverska18>	It's possible to bring KODI into debian but by the time you factor in the cleaness of the Plymouth boot under 'buntu I quit fighting.
T 1431544275 18<yin_nadie18>	I wasn't aware of that. I'm a mplayer2 user myself >:þ
T 1431544324 18<foreverska18>	Yea.  KODI is nice because you get lots of plugins and stuff... personally I just use VLC but... casuals
T 1431544371 18<yin_nadie18>	indeed. casuals 
T 1431544512 18<foreverska18>	If I let the software rendering go at full speed it's not TOO bad...  I'm going to focus group this version I think.
T 1431544658 18<yin_nadie18>	oh, Eris. focus groups >:þ
T 1431544923 18<foreverska18>	It must be worse for game devs
T 1431544978 18<foreverska18>	I luckily don't have a ton to be critiqued on.
T 1431544989 18<foreverska18>	Just "this load time is absurd"
T 1431545002 18<yin_nadie18>	focus groups are horrible for most. Comparing between different dev types is like comparing having an arm or a leg cut
T 1431545012 18<yin_nadie18>	well. that's something
T 1431545027 18<Xeek18>	I will not be writing games for atom processors :-P
T 1431545059 18<foreverska18>	lol.  They want this ported for an ARM processor.  I have more hope for that machine.  Big 8 core guy.
T 1431545087 18<Xeek18>	It seems that ARM CPUs have evolved a lot more than Atoms.. really the atom is a failure in the marketplace IMO
T 1431545093 18<Xeek18>	Consumers didnt' buy it
T 1431545100 18<Xeek18>	The ones that did were sorry
T 1431545144 18<foreverska18>	Didn't the Eee have an Atom?  I liked that little laptop
T 1431545165 18<Xeek18>	you liked it for what?
T 1431545174 18<foreverska18>	Word processing mostly. lol
T 1431545182 18<foreverska18>	Light programming.
T 1431545188 18<Xeek18>	I can't tell you how many complaints I got from customers that bought that piece of junk, back when I was in retail
T 1431545201 18<Xeek18>	it BARELY ran office anad really didn't meant the minimum requirements
T 1431545215 18<Xeek18>	meet*
T 1431545288 18<Xeek18>	The problem with that is... if typing is all you do all day then fine, but who only does typing?
T 1431545311 18<Xeek18>	For anyone that does anything else, why would you buy a machin ejust for word processing when if you spent some real money it could do just about anything you needed it to do
T 1431545327 18<foreverska18>	Yea, it was never GREAT but it got me through Air Force tech school.
T 1431546018 18<Xeek18>	Oh the memories, of customers walking in with them with broken screens and then they ask, "So how much will it cost to fix the screen?"
T 1431546054 18<Xeek18>	I ask, how much did the laptop cost? They say "$150". I say, the screen replacement with labor is triple that
