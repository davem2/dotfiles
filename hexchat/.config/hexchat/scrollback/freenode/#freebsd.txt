T 1454429107 18<TheLostAdmin18>	My guess as to why curl is so damn buggy, as you put it, is because it is trying to combine multiple tools into a single tool and it relies on a number of other libraries to do so.
T 1454429136 18<feebsd918>	TheLostAdmin: Everything is separated on Unix, though?
T 1454429143 18<feebsd918>	So it should not report that "curl" is the culprit.
T 1454429149 18<feebsd918>	But instead some dependency library.
T 1454429211 18<TheLostAdmin18>	feebsd9, that depends on how curl is built. If it was made to make use of shared libraries, then the library would get the report. If it was built to make use of statically linked libraries, then curl is the culprit.
T 1454429282 18<TheLostAdmin18>	Since curl is a tool from the Linux world, and FreeBSD includes many libraries in "base" that are considered 3rd party in the Linux world (like OpenSSL), curl may be statically linked to avoid conflicts with differences in the default libraries of FreeBSD.
T 1454429297 18<TheLostAdmin18>	It is also entirely possible that I'm wrong. This is, after all, a guess.
T 1454429326 18<TheLostAdmin18>	I use fetch instead of curl. It's not as robust, but it's part of the FreeBSD base system.
T 1454429328 18<koobs18>	It could also be that, being so popular, and being used in my vendor products and appliances, that many more bugs (and security) issues are found.

T 1454429350 18<TheLostAdmin18>	That's at least as good a guess as mine, koobs.
T 1454429358 18<koobs18>	The number of CVE's/Security issues a project publishes is not a good measure for how buggy it is
T 1454429368 18<feebsd918>	"fetch" isn't so "fetch".
T 1454429372 18<TheLostAdmin18>	That is definitely true, koobs.
T 1454429372 18<koobs18>	It may be a function of how much code auditing gets done on it, and how transparent the project is
T 1454429383 18<feebsd918>	I think I only use cURL because PHP had a module for it and not for fetch.
