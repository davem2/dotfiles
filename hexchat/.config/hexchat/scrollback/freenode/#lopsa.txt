T 1432221943 18<Fetch18>	FrozenFire: use Ansible to define all cronjobs on all hosts. Best of all worlds (cronjobs are centrally known and defined, but you aren't relying on an agent being able to connect to all necessary hosts at the same time to execute a job)

T 1432222133 18<FrozenFire18>	Fetch, That's actually something I've been avoiding. I don't like having all of these configuration fragments for tasks scattered around the infrastructure.
T 1432222168 18<FrozenFire18>	Yes, they're all theoretically defined in the ansible config, but that's more of an append operation than a replace operation, so to speak
T 1432222194 18<FrozenFire18>	I'd prefer to move all of this configuration to a central place and then wipe the cron configs on all servers
T 1432222216 18<FrozenFire18>	Might be a bit aggressive of an approach. I'm just toying with it right now.

T 1432222493 18<f3ew18>	FrozenFire: Mozilla has a distributed cron thing
T 1432222554 18<f3ew18>	Alternatively, what you want is a makefile which distributes tasks via a queue to agents on different hosts and handles coordination as required
