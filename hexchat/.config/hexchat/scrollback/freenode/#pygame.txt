T 1445707369 18<deshipu18>	not to mention they completely ignore the quantum effects, so it's wrong anyways
T 1445707431 18<deshipu18>	I wonder if anybody made a proper quantum raytracer, that works on confugurations and magnitudes, not "rays" and particles
T 1445707521 18<Yaiyan18>	I mean, surely you're just oversimulating at that point
