T 1452967889 18<rikai18>	To be honest, the web side of things could use a lot of work... and there's lots of stuff planned... Just lack of time on cbojar and i's part xD
T 1452967933 18<rikai18>	I personally havent been able to really do much of note in quite a while between not having a stable dev setup and JB stuff... cbojar's been a lifesaver <3

T 1452969057 18<nelsk18>	there's a good amount of issues that seem to document what you guys would like to see
T 1452969210 18<cbojar18>	yes, the issues are the best record left of what we talked about. there might be some things missing still, but oh well
T 1452969218 18<rikai18>	I'm mostly referring to more far-future things that we never really wrote down. :P
T 1452969295 18<nelsk18>	anything in particular you can remember rikai?
T 1452969307 18<nelsk18>	I liked the steam game count plugin :)
T 1452969944 18<cbojar18>	there is a closed pr that tried to make that happen. unfortunately that didn't end up getting merged in, but its still there

T 1452972585 18<rikai18>	nelsk: it probably didn't help that we decided we wanted to use the steam API directly, which would have probably meant mostly rewriting it. :P
T 1452972809 18<nelsk18>	rikai: guilty. wish I was doing more node these days
