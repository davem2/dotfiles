# Dotfiles

Various configuration files for my Arch Linux desktop boxes 


## TODO
- Add deployment/setup helpers.. 
    - Use Mapping file to describe how dotfiles are symlinked.  This will allow for the dotfile repo structure to be independent of actual location in system.
    - Group files into packages to make it easy to create custom deployments for different setups or muliple operating system support. (something like make?)
